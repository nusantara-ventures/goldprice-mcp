 * The distribution name changed to `@nusantara-ventures/goldprice-mcp` in
 * 0.2.0. Deriving the wire identity from it would have silently rewritten
 * every User-Agent the backend sees, so the same client would read as one
 * install disappearing and a new one appearing in API analytics. A rename on
 * npm is a packaging event; it is not a new client.
 *
 * Keep this stable across future renames. Change it only when the client's
 * behaviour actually changes.
